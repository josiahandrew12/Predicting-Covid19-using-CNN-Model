# Predicting COVID19 using CNN Models
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infection that has spread worldwide and with no automatic model to reliably detect its presence from images. We aim to investigate the potential of deep  learning to predict COVID-19 infection using chest computed tomography (CT) and x-ray images. We used a public dataset available SARS-CoV-2 CT scan dataset containing 1252 CT scans that are positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and 1230 CT scans for patients non-infected by SARS-CoV-2, 2482 CT scans in total.
